# magidash

DOS game I wrote in 1995

## How to run

Use DosBox to run the game.  The game is in the `release` folder. Run `MAGIDASH.EXE` to start the game.

By default DosBox is emulating a CPU which is slightly slower than what I had 1995. As a result the game might be a bit slow, you can speed it up by pressing `CTRL-F12` to increase the cycles. Around 15k cycles should be enough.

## Notes

Best to start with cheats enabled. start it with 

```
magidash magic
```

This activates a few keyboard combinations:
* F1 + F5 + F10: next level
* F3 + F4: restart level
* B + F5 + F1: previous level
* P + A + S: give both players 5 lives
* F6 + 0: Player 1 gets an extra figure to control (at starting location)
* F6 + 2: Player 2 gets an extra figure to control (at starting location)
